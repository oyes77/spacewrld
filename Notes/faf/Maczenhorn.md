It's a planet goberned by the Azcaarntar, the Khamzen, and the Thilenar, the only planet only habited with species from the other three planets, it once was called home by a long forgotten civilization that now died with all their history as far as it's known. The Azcaarntar coming from Nbubn, the Thilenar coming from Lithern, and the Khamzen coming from Kth'amai, this planet works as the beam that connects the other three trough massive towers that contain a big Homestone, which allows interplanetary travel.
