Nbubn is a disk shaped planet, 5 times more tall than wide, its center is made of melting hot magma that's covered of a big cloud of smoke/fog that you can't breathe, where creatures evolved to be made of sturdy minerals to live around it and hunt, while the ends of the furthest parts from the nucleus are ice cold montain-like formations,
