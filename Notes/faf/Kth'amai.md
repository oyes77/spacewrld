SA planet made of purple sand, it's deadly cold when it's not facing the sun, and when the sun hits the ground, the sand becomes a really slippery kilometers deep layer of constantly melting glass, allowing the their people to live under the sand where the glass is stable. 
They live on interconnected caverns where the night is completely dark and covered with layers and layers of sand, and the day is evenly lit by the refractions of the sun kilometers on the surface.
