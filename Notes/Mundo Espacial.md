I was thinking on a more space travel type shit, not trough spaceships though, that would kinda break it for me I think. They travel between small planets the size of a big city, so really it's not that sci-fi as a setting, days are a few hours, but It would mean it's small enough for a bunch of players to enjoy.

The transportation between planets happen trough a worked mineral called Homestone a light blue stone that all species grow in some parts of their body, and that feeds of the being's energy in order to use it's powers. (limited to)

### Planetas:
- [[Lithernn]]
- [[Maczenhorn]]  (THE HUB)
- [[Nbubn]] (Bunn)
- [[Kth'amai]] (Tamai)
