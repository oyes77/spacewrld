I was thinking on a more space travel type shit, not trough spaceships though, that would kinda break it for me I think. They travel between small planets the size of a big city, so really it's not that sci-fi as a setting, days are a few hours, but It would mean it's small enough for a bunch of players to enjoy.

The transportation between planets happen trough a mineral called [[Notes/faf/Homestone]], a light blue stone that all species grow in some parts of their body, and that feeds of   the being's energy in order to use it's powers. (limited to)

There would be 4 planets:
- [[Lithernn]]
- [[Maczenhorn]]  (THE HUB)
- [[Nbubn]] (Bunn)
- [[Kth'amai]] (Tamai)

# Stuff I have to add to each:

- [ ] General intro
- [ ] Species
	- [ ] Appareance
	- [ ] Lifespan
	- [ ] Relationships with other species
		- Make this through metadata of each species' note
	- [ ] 
- [ ] Culture/s
	- Might go on the species' notes and then extract blocks for the bigger explanations, maybe.
	- Include any important characterization here I guess
- [ ] Lore/known and uknown backstory 
- [ ] Geography / Landmarks
- [ ] Religion
- [ ] Magic
- [ ] Monsters/creatures
- [ ]
