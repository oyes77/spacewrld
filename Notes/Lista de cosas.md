# Stuff I have to add to each:

- [ ] General intro
- [ ] Species
	- [ ] Appareance
	- [ ] Lifespan
	- [ ] Relationships with other species
		- Make this through metadata of each species' note
	- [ ] 
- [ ] Culture/s
	- Might go on the species' notes and then extract blocks for the bigger explanations, maybe.
	- Include any important characterization here I guess
- [ ] Lore/known and uknown backstory 
- [ ] Geography / Landmarks
- [ ] Religion
- [ ] Magic
- [ ] Monsters/creatures
